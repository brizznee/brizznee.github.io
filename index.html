<p> First, and foremost, good communication design is easy to achieve. Don’t believe the hype. T truly believe that the hype of making a “good” design is usually what messes people up. Good is an – extremely –   subjective word, and what I notice with my friends and colleagues who are new to design is that they tend to go hard rather than go home. New designers tend to make more bold and flamboyant choices than more experienced ones. I don’t know why.</p>

<p> I do know that my design teacher’s website is a straightforward, some could say plain, website with a white background, black text, and no images. Meanwhile, the last two times I asked my inexperienced friends to design a poster for an event, they both had somehow landed on red text and a glittery bright blue background sprinkled with semi-relevant image cut outs. It’s truly a conundrum. </p>

<p> What I can make of it is that people equate “good” with “exciting” and forget that all communication must be clear. This isn’t to say design can’t be exciting. Creating something unique, to me, is essential. Instead I say, as long as whatever you make is clever, creative, and concise, it’s good.

  <p>“I’m excited but still pretty nervous. I just feel like something’s going to go wrong,” he mentioned as I sat down in his passengers’ seat of his car. Levin recently became KTSW’s Promotions Director and was getting ready for his first Third Thursday of the year. Like a good executive, he played the station as he drove to the venue. </p>

 <p>“I didn’t get any sleep last night,” he sighed. “I just feel like something’s fucked.”  It was one hour before setup, and we decided to get a quick bite to eat before heading that way. Though Third Thursday is one of many events KTSW holds a semester, it has always been a staple especially after all the change the department has gone through over the last year. Levin’s first year at the station, KTSW decided to cancel MR Fest, the local festival they had been putting on for 10 years. If that wasn’t enough, due to the construction at LBJ, their Lunchbox Concert Series was now on hiatus.</p>

<p> “It kind of sucks because there is this pressure to do more and build from the previous years, but all these different obstacles keep appearing,” says Levin. “Third Thursday is my favorite event, so I’m happy that it’s still happening. It was the first KTSW event I ever really went to, so it holds a special place in my heart.” After knowing Levin for nearly two years now, I could tell he was a bit anxious. I asked him if he’s ever been under this much pressure. He told me, “Never. This is sort of my break out event. If things don’t go right, I don’t want people to think that I can’t do a good job. Also, this is my staff’s first event, and I want to make a good impression.” </p>

<p> He explained previously about the potential sponsor who would be coming to scope out the event to see if it would be a good fit for them. This meant high attendance and making everything look under control was a must. Regulars considered Third Thursday as KTSW’s most popular event.  It was common knowledge that if the first one tanked the rest would follow suit. </p>

<p> While driving, he kept going over everything to make sure once he arrived at the venue things would fall into place. Bands know when to get there? Check. Staff knows their shifts? Check. It seemed as if everything was going to go smoothly until he received a troubling text. Pulling into the nearest parking lot he read, “Kiva triple booked”. </p>


<p> Three different bands had arrived, for three separate events. A band that wasn’t booked for Third Thursday was taking the stage first. Kiva has been home to Third Thursday since the demolition of Triple Crown and is known for their terrible management.  Due to San Marcos’ lack of venues fit for the event, Levin decided to go with them regardless. Unfortunately, he was now in this predicament and wasn’t taking the information very well. </p>

    <p> Speechless, I let him know everything was going to be fine, but I knew a billion and one things were going through his mind. Will he need to cancel? What would the bands think? And how does someone book three separate events for the same time and day? He tried calling the venue owner but it kept going straight to voicemail. </p>

    <p> “I have no clue what to do,” he told me. Meanwhile, the anxiety took hold as people from his staff were texting him asking what to do next. He was in full panic mode and struggling to breathe. I let him know it was going to be okay and offered advice as to how to solve this issue as we made our way to the venue. </p>

<p> From my past experience as Station Manager, I knew exactly what situation he was in and how to move forward. Though college radio is considered a learning workshop with low real-life consequences, the students involved take it very seriously. It’s something that’s hard to comprehend until you’re in that environment. </p>


<p> When we arrived at Kiva, he was able to salvage the event.  From my standpoint, it went well. The bands were good and so was the turn out. You really couldn’t tell that right before the event, everything was a huge mess. The night was full of moshing and good music—the two main elements of a successful Third Thursday. Throughout the night people complimented Levin and were surprised by the fact that things got off to a bad start.  “I had a great time,” said Caroline, one of Levin’s new staff members. “I can’t wait to see how the rest of the year goes. He killed it.” </p>

<p> When the event was over, I helped Levin pack up. “I’m honestly so happy it’s over,” he said. “The bands were great, and the sponsors and staff were happy. That’s all I really wanted. I’m still pretty upset about Kiva. Not sure what I’m going to do about that.” He asked me about my thoughts and mentioned that he respected my opinion. I told him the truth, “Honestly it’s your first event. You have a whole year to prove yourself. Don’t get too caught up. You had a great event and will have many more opportunities.” </p>
