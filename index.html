<!-- one-->


<p> It’s another Thursday night in San Marcos. As per usual every student is excited to hit the square, drink, and celebrate the three-day weekend. Everyone… except for Levin. This Thursday, the third Thursday of the month, was more nerve wrecking to him than the midterms he took earlier that week. As his first event of the year, it’s super important that it goes well. </p>

<!-- two-->

  <p>“I’m excited but still pretty nervous. I just feel like something’s going to go wrong,” he mentioned as I sat down in his passengers’ seat of his car. Levin recently became KTSW’s Promotions Director and was getting ready for his first Third Thursday of the year. Like a good executive, he played the station as he drove to the venue. </p>

 <p>“I didn’t get any sleep last night,” he sighed. “I just feel like something’s fucked.”  It was one hour before setup, and we decided to get a quick bite to eat before heading that way. Though Third Thursday is one of many events KTSW holds a semester, it has always been a staple especially after all the change the department has gone through over the last year. Levin’s first year at the station, KTSW decided to cancel MR Fest, the local festival they had been putting on for 10 years. If that wasn’t enough, due to the construction at LBJ, their Lunchbox Concert Series was now on hiatus.</p>

<p> “It kind of sucks because there is this pressure to do more and build from the previous years, but all these different obstacles keep appearing,” says Levin. “Third Thursday is my favorite event, so I’m happy that it’s still happening. It was the first KTSW event I ever really went to, so it holds a special place in my heart.” After knowing Levin for nearly two years now, I could tell he was a bit anxious. I asked him if he’s ever been under this much pressure. He told me, “Never. This is sort of my break out event. If things don’t go right, I don’t want people to think that I can’t do a good job. Also, this is my staff’s first event, and I want to make a good impression.” </p>

<p> He explained previously about the potential sponsor who would be coming to scope out the event to see if it would be a good fit for them. This meant high attendance and making everything look under control was a must. Regulars considered Third Thursday as KTSW’s most popular event.  It was common knowledge that if the first one tanked the rest would follow suit. </p>

<p> While driving, he kept going over everything to make sure once he arrived at the venue things would fall into place. Bands know when to get there? Check. Staff knows their shifts? Check. It seemed as if everything was going to go smoothly until he received a troubling text. Pulling into the nearest parking lot he read, “Kiva triple booked”. </p>


<p> Three different bands had arrived, for three separate events. A band that wasn’t booked for Third Thursday was taking the stage first. Kiva has been home to Third Thursday since the demolition of Triple Crown and is known for their terrible management.  Due to San Marcos’ lack of venues fit for the event, Levin decided to go with them regardless. Unfortunately, he was now in this predicament and wasn’t taking the information very well. </p>

    <p> Speechless, I let him know everything was going to be fine, but I knew a billion and one things were going through his mind. Will he need to cancel? What would the bands think? And how does someone book three separate events for the same time and day? He tried calling the venue owner but it kept going straight to voicemail. </p>

    <p> “I have no clue what to do,” he told me. Meanwhile, the anxiety took hold as people from his staff were texting him asking what to do next. He was in full panic mode and struggling to breathe. I let him know it was going to be okay and offered advice as to how to solve this issue as we made our way to the venue. </p>

<p> From my past experience as Station Manager, I knew exactly what situation he was in and how to move forward. Though college radio is considered a learning workshop with low real-life consequences, the students involved take it very seriously. It’s something that’s hard to comprehend until you’re in that environment. </p>


<p> When we arrived at Kiva, he was able to salvage the event.  From my standpoint, it went well. The bands were good and so was the turn out. You really couldn’t tell that right before the event, everything was a huge mess. The night was full of moshing and good music—the two main elements of a successful Third Thursday. Throughout the night people complimented Levin and were surprised by the fact that things got off to a bad start.  “I had a great time,” said Caroline, one of Levin’s new staff members. “I can’t wait to see how the rest of the year goes. He killed it.” </p>

<p> When the event was over, I helped Levin pack up. “I’m honestly so happy it’s over,” he said. “The bands were great, and the sponsors and staff were happy. That’s all I really wanted. I’m still pretty upset about Kiva. Not sure what I’m going to do about that.” He asked me about my thoughts and mentioned that he respected my opinion. I told him the truth, “Honestly it’s your first event. You have a whole year to prove yourself. Don’t get too caught up. You had a great event and will have many more opportunities.” </p>

  <p> KTSW/KAT radio just celebrated their 35th anniversary. Over KTSW’s long history, a lot has changed. Students have molded departments, created long-running shows and concert series, and even MR Fest, which celebrated its tenth anniversary in 2016 before being subsequently cancelled. Students have built whole career tracks by way of KTSW. It’s only been two years since I graduated, and even to me, some things look unrecognizable. </p>


<p> For many students, KTSW is where they’ve gotten a taste of their careers. “I wouldn’t be where I am now without all the skills I learned at KTSW” says ESPN radio producer Matt Clearlin. “I graduated back in 2002, and I still carry what I learned with me.” </p>

    <p>Since 1982, the promotions department has been one of the few constants. Known for being the face of the station, the promotions department is the main form of communication between KTSW and Texas State students. If you frequent the quad, you can usually spot the promotions team working hard and passing out fliers at the tent. Each of them can give you a short speech of what KTSW is and what events are coming.</p>

    <p>Like anything else, the department continues to change. “We did, like, four other events, including Third Thursday, back in the MR Fest days,” says Levin. “Now that we don’t have those events, I’m finding other ways to innovate in my department, like building our street team. When Hannah was here she did so much. She really made you feel like you were a part of something and I want to continue that feeling.” <p>

<p> Hannah Bennet was the Promotion Director when I was Station Manager. I can admit that when she left there were big shoes to fill. Unfortunately, the subsequent year the department’s development became stagnant due to inconsistencies in leadership. Since being under Hannah, Levin has seen varying levels of success in his department. Now under his leadership, he wants to make sure there’s growth. </p>


<p> “I think the reason I feel so much pressure is because I’m building on a legacy,” said Levin. “I’ve seen how hard the directors before me had worked, and I want to build a name for myself. Previous promotions directors could gauge their success by how well MR Fest was executed, so I’m kind of the first director to actually figure out what that means now that it’s gone.” </p>

<p>  “I didn’t have a clue of what I wanted to do when I came to Texas State,” said Levin “I just knew I wanted to leave the valley.” He explained, although he loved his hometown of Edcouch-Elsa, it was too small for his ambition given people there don’t tend to leave. He wanted something different. “I didn’t have clearly defined plan, but when I saw the KTSW promo tent during freshmen orientation and all the free CDs they were giving out, I knew it was something I really wanted to be a part of.” </p>

<p> That day he introduced himself to Hannah Bennett and asked how he could join. “It’s pretty crazy because I know I’m one of the few incoming freshmen that was hired that year. I’m happy I’m in the position I’m in now, but I originally just wanted to be around people who were into the same things as me.” </p>

<p>Two months after the Third Thursday fiasco, Levin and I met up at a nearby coffee shop. He mentioned to me that since that event, he has gained a lot of confidence in his abilities as a leader. “Our last Third Thursday was at Aquabrew, and it went extremely well. There were a ton of people there and the venue is super down to do stuff with us in the future,” says Levin.  “Ironically, the venue also double booked, so I need to re-evaluate but on a positive note I handled it a lot better this time.” </p>

    <p> According to his colleagues, they’ve all agreed that he’s been killing it. “Levin has really proven himself. Promotions was a bit of a mess before, but he’s really brought in some great ideas and an amazing work ethic,” says Chase Massey, the current Station Manager. “I never really have to worry about him.”  </p>

    <p> His staff expresses the same feeling. “He’s a good leader. He’s really put the department back in shape and has made everyone feel like they’re a part of something big,” says Aimee, assistant promotions director.  “Hannah made everyone feel like they were a part of a family, and I really hope that my staff feels like I’m doing that as well,” says Levin. “I think that’s what makes KTSW special. It creates purpose and community. It makes you feel like what your doing matters. That’s why I care so much and want to do best by the station.” Hearing that is any KTSW alumni’s dream.  </p>
