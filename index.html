<p> First, and foremost, good communication design is easy to achieve. Don’t believe the hype. T truly believe that the hype of making a “good” design is usually what messes people up. Good is an – extremely –   subjective word, and what I notice with my friends and colleagues who are new to design is that they tend to go hard rather than go home. New designers tend to make more bold and flamboyant choices than more experienced ones. I don’t know why.</p>

<p> I do know that my design teacher’s website is a straightforward, some could say plain, website with a white background, black text, and no images. Meanwhile, the last two times I asked my inexperienced friends to design a poster for an event, they both had somehow landed on red text and a glittery bright blue background sprinkled with semi-relevant image cut outs. It’s truly a conundrum. </p>

<p> What I can make of it is that people equate “good” with “exciting” and forget that all communication must be clear. This isn’t to say design can’t be exciting. Creating something unique, to me, is essential. Instead I say, as long as whatever you make is clever, creative, and concise, it’s good.

    <h2 id="C3"> CLEVER </h2>
    <p> You don’t have to be smart, you just need to be effective. Smart always implies that someone is intelligent where clever does not. To be clever is to be a problem solver.  A clever designer knows what their audience wants and that guides the work they produce. You can make a really hip, colorful, and visually amazing website but if your client is a bank frequented by the elderly, they probably won’t appreciate it. They just want to be able to find when the bank opens. Your time would’ve been wasted. </p>

<p> Save time. Be clever. Always have your audience in mind.  </p>

<h2 id="C3"> CREATIVE</h2>

<p> You don’t have to be artistic, you just need to be original. “But Brittany, is anything really ‘original’ anymore”. Yeah, I hear you. All I’m saying is that good design is distinct. Even if it’s just black words on a white background. Memorable > Remarkable. We can’t all be artist, that’s why we are designers.  I mean that with love.
