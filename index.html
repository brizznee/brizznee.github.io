<p> First, and foremost, good communication design is easy to achieve. Don’t believe the hype. T truly believe that the hype of making a “good” design is usually what messes people up. Good is an – extremely –   subjective word, and what I notice with my friends and colleagues who are new to design is that they tend to go hard rather than go home. New designers tend to make more bold and flamboyant choices than more experienced ones. I don’t know why.</p>

<p> I do know that my design teacher’s website is a straightforward, some could say plain, website with a white background, black text, and no images. Meanwhile, the last two times I asked my inexperienced friends to design a poster for an event, they both had somehow landed on red text and a glittery bright blue background sprinkled with semi-relevant image cut outs. It’s truly a conundrum. </p>

<p> What I can make of it is that people equate “good” with “exciting” and forget that all communication must be clear. This isn’t to say design can’t be exciting. Creating something unique, to me, is essential. Instead I say, as long as whatever you make is clever, creative, and concise, it’s good.
